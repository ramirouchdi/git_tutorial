# git_tutorial
This is not a real project. It's just a sandbox to try git branch, release, merging and other commands before applying them to any of my real projects.
Find out a good [GIT tutorial](https://youtu.be/zTjRZNkhiEU?si=3U_XUYTLUktVjPD4) from [freeCodeCamp.org youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp).
